CodeMaker GitHub Action

## How to use

This GitHub action takes 3 (required) inputs:

* api-key: Your CodeMaker API Key. For security, please consider using [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) to provide this value.  
* mode: CodeMaker generation mode. Currently we support code, docs or unit-tests.  
* path: The path of the file to process.  

## Example workflow configuration

The following example workflow includes 3 steps:
